       <div className=" p-1">EatFit is the most accurate, comprehensive 
       daily food-logs tracking platform on earth. Unlike other platform in the market, 
       our nutritional data is curated from verified, accurate sources.
        We aim to provide a complete solution – no matter what diet you choose
         to be on.<br></br><br></br>
         EatFit is built as a side 
         project in 2020. We were following the CRON diet (Calorie Restriction 
         with Optimal Nutrition) and being the nutrition nerd/software developer 
         that we are, decided to build a platform to track our diet. 
         Thus, EatFit was born.
         <br></br><br></br>There are now over  million users who are happy he did.
   <br></br><br></br>
   EatFit success has hinged entirely on positive word-of-mouth from its users. We are still – and plans to continue being – a bootstrap startup to this day.<br></br><br></br>
